### Publication profiles of researchers from their Google Scholar pages

A researcher's Google Scholar page allows you to see a snapshot of their publication history and has a graph with the number of citations their papers have received on a yearly basis. It may be of interest to learn more about a researcher's publication profile. This tool may be useful particularly for junior researchers trying to understand the trajectory and current state of published research output from more senior researchers. 


### Overview

The code in this repository displays the following information for a given researcher: 
  - graph of the number of citations for each year
  - graph of the number of papers published for each year
  - graph and csv of the number of times the researcher has published in a given journal
  - graph of the number of times the researcher has published in a given journal segmented by year

All of this output is saved on the user's computer within the folder the code lives in, under the subfolder ```results/{subjectid}``` where subjectid is the unique id associated with a researchers google scholar profile. It can be found in the url to their google scholar. For example, ```l8WuQJgAAAAJ``` is the subject id for the profile with the following url:  ```https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l8WuQJgAAAAJ&hl=en```
